Data Structures Project for the 3rd Semester

First Part:

The program will take an infix expression and display its post-order, pre-order, and in-order representations, as well as its expression tree.

Second Part:

The program will sort an array (the size is determined within the program) using various methods and measure the time taken by each method to sort the array.
This program helps visualize the comparison of complexities with different data volumes by ranking these methods.
